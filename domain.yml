      Ok, I have found an answer for my question. So I'm posting it here, in hopes that it will be useful for another person:<br><br>For whatever bizarre reason, the graphical interface of <code>hp-setup</code> is busted. So one needs to start:<br><br>sudo hp-setup -i<br><br>The <code>-i</code> key is essential because without it, the setup doesn't proceed either. At this time, I still haven't gotten the test page out, but the scanner is working properly, which is what I was needing originally.

  #     This should be fixed by running in the terminal:<br><code>sudo apt-get install -f</code><br><br>If you installed drivers from the Epson site, they require some other packages to be installed too. But the problem is that 13.10 is not supported anymore, and you won't get these packages from the repository.<br><br>There is a way to connect to the \"old-releases\" repository, but I suggest upgrading the system to 14.04.<br><br>This will be closed as off-topic anyway, since the question is about an unsupported release.

      I have finally achieved it. This is how I have done it. <br>With the help of

      and with <a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#DCP-8110DN" target="_blank">the official instructions</a>:
      <br>This web page takes you to the download page of the drivers and to the instructions.<br><br>
      Brother's cupswrapper <a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn1a.html">driver page for my printer</a>.
      <br>Brother's LPR <a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn3.html" target="_blank">driver install page for my printer</a>.
      <br><br>I am installing this printer on Ubuntu 13.10 just a week after 13.10 was released.
      <br>The drivers that Ubuntu tries to install by default, from the gutenprint project, fail.
      So I have to do it manually. Possibly if Ubuntu polishes and fixes the default installation method,
      it may work in the future, as it was working by default in Ubuntu 13.04.<br>
      I am connecting to the printer via USB. In a later version of this tutorial,
      I will explain how to connect via LAN.
      <br>I download these two files from the mentioned Brother's pages.<br>
      <code>dcp8110dnlpr-3.0.0-1.i386.deb <br>dcp8110dncupswrapper-3.0.0-1.i386.deb<br></code><br>
      In theory, I can choose to install either the CUPS one or the LPR one.
      But it seems that if you choose to install the CUPS one, you have to install first the LPR one and then the CUPS one.
      And this is what I am going to describe, how to install both in order to get the CUPS driver to work.
      I am choosing CUPS as it is a more modern system.
      <br>Procedure: <br><br>
      Install Apparmor utils (with sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils or with the Ubuntu software centre)<br>
      <code>sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils</code><br>
      Let's tell Apparmor (aa) not to complain (aa-complain) about CUPS (cupsd package)<br>
      <code>sudo aa-complain cupsd</code><br>
      Let's create a directory necessary for the installation. But in my case, Ubuntu replied that the directory was already present.<br>
      <code>sudo mkdir /usr/share/cups/model</code><br>
      Let's install the LPR driver (of course you need to navigate with the command line to the folder where you have downloaded the driver file)
      (Quick tip: Use "cd" to navigate in the command line, example "cd Documents" to go to a subfolder called Documents inside your present folder,
      or "cd .." to go to an upper folder)<br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all dcp8110dnlpr-3.0.0-1.i386.deb</code><br>
      Install cupswrapper driver<br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all dcp8110dncupswrapper-3.0.0-1.i386.deb</code><br>
      Check if the LPR driver and cupswrapper driver are installed<br>
      <code>dpkg -l | grep Brother</code><br><br>
      This is the output I get on my computer for this command:<br>
      <code>ii  dcp8110dcupswrapper 3.0.0-1 i386 Brother DCP-8110D CUPS wrapper driver</code><br>
      <code>ii  dcp8110dncupswrapper 3.0.0-1 i386 Brother DCP-8110DN CUPS wrapper driver</code><br>
      <code>ii  dcp8110dnlpr 3.0.0-1 i386 Brother DCP-8110DN LPR driver</code><br>
      <code>ii  printer-driver-ptouch 1.3-6 i386 printer driver Brother P-touch label printers</code><br><br>
      I am connecting to the printer via USB. Now let's check via the CUPS interface if the printer is present.
      Let's open a browser and go to: <a href="http://localhost:631/printers">localhost:631/printers</a><br><br>
      Following the official instructions, we should:<br><br>
      - Check if the Device URI of your printer is "usb://Brother/(your printer's model name)"<br><br>
      If the device URI is different from the example above, please go to "Modify Printer" of your printer
      to select proper device and driver. How to do this: Click on the printer's name; you are sent to another page,
      that should display the URI in the "Connexion" area.<br><br>
      The output I get from the CUPS interface on my computer is:<br><br>
      usb://Brother/DCP-8110DN?serial=E70745A3N358848<br><br>
      Also, as a side note, in my case, the first time I printed a page, a first page was printed saying that I installed the wrong driver,
      but I know I did everything correctly. Also, this page has not appeared again:<br>
      In my computer, the printing works well.<br>
      <h2>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2><br>
      Scanning:<br>
      We need 2 files, the scanner driver (32bits or 64bits) and an extra file. <br>
      Driver file name on July 2014. <br>
      32 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code><br>
      64 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code><br>
      Extra file name on July 2014:<br>
      <code>brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb<br></code><br>
      1) Getting the driver file<br>
      You need a 32bit or 64bit version of the driver. <br>
      You can check your Linux version by typing on a terminal <code>uname -a</code><br>
      This is the output of <code>uname -a</code> in a 32bits system: (notice i686 and/or i386)<br><br>
      Linux tommy 2.6.38-8-generic-pae #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11<br>
      05:17:09 UTC 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux<br><br>
      This is the output of <code>uname -a</code> in a 64bits system: (notice x86_64)<br><br>
      Linux webserver 2.6.28-19-server #64-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 18 22:43:50<br>
      UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux<br><br>
      After you know if your system is 32bit or 64bit, go to your printer's drivers page, accept their EULA, and download your driver. 
      In July 2014, the driver names are respectively:<br>
      32 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code><br>
      64 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code><br>
      2) Getting the extra file:<br>
      After you have downloaded your driver, you will see on that page there is a procedure about how to install the driver, 
      and in the 5th item of the description, there is a link that says "<code>Use your usb-connectrd scanner by a normal user</code>",
      click on it, then you will be taken to another page with information about several Linux distributions.
      For Ubuntu 10.10 to 13.10 (valid also for more recent ones, such as the current one now, 14.04),
      there is a link that says "<code>1. Click here to download the file.(brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb, ver.1.0.0-1, 2KB)</code>",
      click on it and get the 'extra' file <code>brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb</code><br>
      Now we have our two files, our driver file (32 bits or 64 bits), and the 'extra' file. We can now install the drivers.<br>
      3) Prerequisite before installing the driver files: We need to be sure our computer has installed the two following files,
      a) <code>sane-utils</code> b) <code>tcsh</code> <br>
      Install them via Ubuntu Software Centre or with the following command in a terminal:<br>
      <code>sudo apt-get install sane-utils tcsh</code><br><br>
      4) Install the driver with your printer turned on and connected via USB. 
      Open a terminal and go to the folder where you saved your driver files, and execute:<br>
      For the 32-bits version:<br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code><br><br>
      For the 64-bits version:<br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code><br><br>
      5) Install the extra file so not only the superuser can use the scanner:<br>
      <code>dpkg -i brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb</code><br><br>
      6) Restarting the computer<br>
      Some people says that restarting the computer is necessary to get the scanner working.
      I tried to get the scanner working without restarting the computer and it did not work.
      I restarted the computer and it worked, but I am not sure if it worked because of the restarting or because of the complete installation process I have done.
      Just reboot, your scanner should work.
      Now we can check if the scanner is working.<br>
      7) Running the Scanner:<br>
      Open a terminal and type:<br>
      <code>brsaneconfig4 -q</code><br><br>
      The output I get on my computer for this command:<br>
      <code>Devices on network<br>
      brsaneconfig4: cups-brf.c 1044: cups-brf-reopen failed whith Brother<br>
      brsaneconfig4: model 'DCP-8110DN' not supported</code><br><br>
      But my computer is not connected to the network.<br>
      I have a brother scanner - printer, I have a brother scanner, I have a brother printer. The scanner and printer works well.

      Let's open a browser and go to: <a href="http://localhost:631/printers">localhost:631/printers</a><br><br>
      Following the official instructions, we should:<br><br>
      - Check if the Device URI of your printer is "usb://Brother/(your printer's model name)"<br><br>
      If the device URI is different from the example above, please go to "Modify Printer" of your printer
      to select proper device and driver. How to do this: Click on the printer's name; you are sent to another page,
      that should display the URI in the "Connexion" area.<br><br>
      The output I get from the CUPS interface on my computer is:<br><br>
      usb://Brother/DCP-8110DN?serial=E70745A3N358848<br><br>
      Also, as a side note, in my case, the first time I printed a page, a first page was printed saying that I installed the wrong driver,
      but I know I did everything correctly. Also, this page has not appeared again:<br>
      In my computer, the printing works well.<br>
      <h2>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2><br>
      Scanning:<br>
      We need 2 files, the scanner driver (32bits or 64bits) and an extra file. <br>
      Driver file name on July 2014. <br>
      32 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code><br>
      64 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code><br>
      Extra file name on July 2014:<br>
      <code>brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb<br></code><br>
      1) Getting the driver file<br>
      You need a 32bit or 64bit version of the driver. <br>
      You can check your Linux version by typing on a terminal <code>uname -a</code><br>
      This is the output of <code>uname -a</code> in a 32bits system: (notice i686 and/or i386)<br><br>
      Linux tommy 2.6.38-8-generic-pae #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11<br>
      05:17:09 UTC 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux<br><br>
      This is the output of <code>uname -a</code> in a 64bits system: (notice x86_64)<br><br>
      Linux webserver 2.6.28-19-server #64-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 18 22:43:50<br>
      UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux<br><br>
      After you know if your system is 32bit or 64bit, go to your printer's drivers page, accept their EULA, and download your driver. 
      In July 2014, the driver names are respectively:<br>
      32 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code><br>
      64 bits: <code>brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code><br>
      2) Getting the extra file:<br>
      After you have downloaded your driver, you will see on that page there is a procedure about how to install the driver, 
      and in the 5th item of the description, there is a link that says "<code>Use your usb-connectrd scanner by a normal user</code>",
      click on it, then you will be taken to another page with information about several Linux distributions.
      For Ubuntu 10.10 to 13.10 (valid also for more recent ones, such as the current one now, 14.04),
      there is a link that says "<code>1. Click here to download the file.(brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb, ver.1.0.0-1, 2KB)</code>",
      click on it and get the 'extra' file <code>brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb</code><br>
      Now we have our two files, our driver file (32 bits or 64 bits), and the 'extra' file. We can now install the drivers.<br>
      3) Prerequisite before installing the driver files: We need to be sure our computer has installed the two following files,
      a) <code>sane-utils</code> b) <code>tcsh</code> <br>
      Install them via Ubuntu Software Centre or with the following command in a terminal:<br>
      <code>sudo apt-get install sane-utils tcsh</code><br><br>
      4) Install the driver with your printer turned on and connected via USB. 
      Open a terminal and go to the folder where you saved your driver files, and execute:<br>
      For the 32-bits version:<br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all brscan4-0.4.2-3.i386.deb</code><br><br>
      For the 64-bits version:<br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i --force-all brscan4-0.4.2-3.amd64.deb</code><br><br>
      5) Install the extra file so not only the superuser can use the scanner:<br>
      <code>dpkg -i brother-udev-rule-type1-1.0.0-1.all.deb</code><br><br>
      6) Restarting the computer<br>
      Some people says that restarting the computer is necessary to get the scanner working.
      I tried to get the scanner working without restarting the computer and it did not work.
      I restarted the computer and it worked, but I am not sure if it worked because of the restarting or because of the complete installation process I have done.
      Just reboot, your scanner should work.
      Now we can check if the scanner is working.<br>
      7) Running the Scanner:<br>
      Open a terminal and type:<br>
      <code>brsaneconfig4 -q</code><br><br>
      The output I get on my computer for this command:<br>
      <code>Devices on network<br>
      brsaneconfig4: cups-brf.c 1044: cups-brf-reopen failed whith Brother<br>
      brsaneconfig4: model 'DCP-8110DN' not supported</code><br><br>
      But my computer is not connected to the network.<br>
      I have a brother scanner - printer, I have a brother scanner, I have a brother printer. The scanner and printer works well.

      Ubuntu 15.04 seems to be not supported by this PPA – the latest change was from 2014-06-23.
      But you can download the matching packages from launchpad and try to install them manually.
      As there seems to be no native 64 bit drivers support, you need to add the 32 bit architecture:
      <code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
      sudo apt-get update</code>
      Download and install the driver for Canon PIXMA MP560 printer - printing functionality:
      <code>wget https://launchpad.net/~michael-gruz/+archive/ubuntu/canon-trunk/+files/cnijfilter-common-32_3.90-76~ubuntu14.04.1_amd64.deb

      The ppd file I must specify is KO423SX.ppd
      To install, add a printer the specify an URI such as lpd://192.168.1.40/print (replacing 192.168.1.40 with your printer's IP address).
      Then specify the KO423SX.ppd file as the ppd file.
      Adjust settings and print. In my case, it claims there's no paper in the printer but still prints correctly.

      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fticrycjyxlp8n2/423_Series_Linux_v10000.zip" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fticrycjyxlp8n2/423_Series_Linux_v10000.zip</a>
      The ppd file I must specify is KO423SX.ppd
      To install, add a printer the specify an URI such as lpd://192.168.1.40/print (replacing 192.168.1.40 with your printer's IP address).
      Then specify the KO423SX.ppd file as the ppd file.
      Adjust settings and print. In my case, it claims there's no paper in the printer but still prints correctly.

      <h3>1. Installing the 64-bit printer driver:</h3>
      You can download it from <a href="http://panasonic.net/pcc/support/fax/common/table/linuxdriver.html" target="_blank">the Panasonic webpage you linked</a>. Here's how to install the 64-bit driver:
      <br><br>
      Open a terminal with <code>Ctrl+Alt+T</code>, and type/paste the following line-by-line:
      <br><br>
      <code>wget -O- http://cs.psn-web.net/support/fax/common/file/Linux_PrnDriver/Driver_Install_files/mccgdi-2.0.3-x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz</code>
      <br>
      <code>cd mccgdi-2.0.3-x86_64</code>
      <br>
      <code>sudo ./install-driver</code>
      <br><br>
      You should see output like the below, after which the driver will be installed. Once it's working, you can remove the <code>mccgdi...</code> folder from Nautilus.
      <br><br>
      <code>start  install......</code>
      <br>
      <code>start install files......</code>
      <br>
      <code>restart spooler - CUPS</code>
      <br>
      Rather than invoking init scripts through <code>/etc/init.d</code>, use the <code>service(8)</code> utility, e.g., <code>service cups restart</code>
      <br>
      Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an Upstart job, you may also use the stop(8) and then start(8) utilities, e.g., <code>stop cups ; start cups</code>. The <code>restart(8)</code> utility is also available.
      <br>
      <code>cups stop/waiting</code>
      <br>
      <code>cups start/running, process 2824</code>
      <br>
      <code>install driver completed</code>
      <br>
      <code>please use "system-config-printer" or "lpadmin" to add printer</code>
      <br><br>
      <h3>2. Installing the 32-bit scanner driver on 64-bit Ubuntu</h3>
      <br>
      There is no guarantee this will actually work since I don't have an MB1900CX to test it.
      <br>
      You have already installed <code>ia32-libs</code>, so you shouldn't need the following. But if <code>dpkg</code> complains trying to install the scanner drivers, you should do the following in a terminal:
      <br>
      <code>sudo apt-get install gcc-4.6-base:i386 libc6:i386 libgcc1:i386 libusb-0.1-4:i386</code>
      <br>
      Download the 32-bit Panasonic <em>libsane</em> driver with:
      <br>
      <code>wget http://cs.psn-web.net/support/fax/common/file/Linux_ScanDriver/libsane-panamfs-1.0.0-i386.deb</code>
      <br>
      And install it with:
      <br>
      <code>sudo dpkg -i libsane-panamfs-1.0.0-i386.deb</code>
      <br><br>
      If all goes well, you will see output like the below, and your scanner functions should also work:
      <br>
      Selecting previously unselected package libsane-panamfs:i386.
      <br>
      (Reading database ... 150731 files and directories currently installed.)
      <br>
      Unpacking libsane-panamfs:i386 (from libsane-panamfs-1.0.0-i386.deb) ...
      <br>
      Setting up libsane-panamfs:i386 (1.0.0-2) ...

      Ok, I have found an answer for your question. So I'm posting it here, hoping that it will be useful for another person:

      For whatever bizarre reason, the graphical interface of <code>hp-setup</code> is busted. So, one needs to start:
      <code>sudo hp-setup -i</code>

      The <code>-i</code> key is essential because without it, the setup doesn't proceed either. At this time, I still haven't gotten the test page out, but the scanner is working properly, which is what I needed originally.

      The specific package that you need to download depends on your version of Ubuntu. If you are running a 32-bit Ubuntu, download <code>epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_i386.deb</code>
      And if you are running 64-bit Ubuntu, download <code>epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb</code>
      These files can be opened using the Ubuntu Software Center by double-clicking on them or installed from the command line by the command

      The volume of comments about issues in upgrading to 12.04 seems pretty scary.<br/><br/>
      Personally, I would make sure all your data stays in the cloud (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-one" target="_blank">Ubuntu One</a>, etc.) and is backed up on external drives (cheap now) and CD/DVD if possible. And when you are ready to go to 12.xx, do a clean install, install your key programs again, and resync the data back in.<br/><br/>
      If you have a fair-sized disk, one good option (that I actually did) was to partition off another 100GB and just put it on that and have that be the new default first item to boot (which it will normally be with this install process) (actually a pretty good way to get several consecutive Ubuntu versions out of 1 machine!!!).

      It sounds like you aren't using a PAE kernel and your 11.10 is 32-bit. Is this right? In order to address all 8GB of RAM, you should consider starting over with a 64-bit operating system.
      As for the upgrade, you should disable all 3rd party sources, then try to update your system, and then upgrade.

      You do not have to uninstall 10.04 in order to upgrade it to 12.04.<br>
      Firstly, you can upgrade your Ubuntu directly using Upgrade manager (as 10.04 and 12.04 are both LTS (long-term support) releases, there's a direct upgrade path, despite 10.04 not being "Ubuntu minus 1"). This will allow you to keep your installed applications and settings:<br>
      <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-from-10-04-or-11-10-to-12-04" target="_blank">How do I upgrade from 10.04 or 11.10 to 12.04?</a><br>
      If you prefer to do a clean re-install, you will need to prepare a bootable Ubuntu 12.04 CD or flash USB drive, back up all your data, boot from the CD, and install 12.04 onto the same partition where 10.04 currently resides. The partition will be formatted in the process, leaving no trace of your old OS.<br>
      This site is full of detailed recipes on how to perform an upgrade or a clean install.

      The transition between 11.04 to 11.10 was quite dramatic since it involved moving from GTK+2/GNOME libraries to GTK+3/GNOME libraries. This is the supported route that was well tested.
      Similarly well tested is the similar 10.04LTS to 12.04 LTS upgrade.
      Moving from 11.04 to 12.04 in one step is not supported, and I urge you not to go down this route since you are more likely to break your desktop & installation.
      Since you have downloaded 12.04, I would go for a fresh install.
      If you have any files & folders from your 11.04 install, back these up - you can reinstall these later.

      will do the trick. There is no need for <code>do-release-upgrade</code> (that won't actually do anything because you are already using 16.04, so there is nowhere to upgrade to). There shouldn't need to be anything else to change; anything that does need changing should be done for you automatically.<br/><br/>
      And just as a side note, <code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> upgrades many things in addition to all that <code>sudo apt-get upgrade</code> does, so there is no need to run both.

      dist-upgrade, in addition to performing the function of upgrade,
      also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions
      of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and
      it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the
      expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade
      command may therefore remove some packages. The

      to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for

      The beta becomes <code>13.04</code> when it is released, so if you've done an upgrade on or after the release date, you should be running equivalent versions as if you'd directly installed <code>13.04</code>.<br>
      (Depending on what point you started the beta, it is possible that you will still have some cruft from beta versions of various software left around - but if you're running <code>apt-get autoremove</code>, you should have got rid of most of it. You might want to install and run <code>deborphan</code> as well, which can find other redundant packages.)

      Both of them suggest that it's probably a mess to upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04 since it would involve 3 upgrades, so it might be easiest to change <code>archive.ubuntu.com</code> to <code>old-releases.ubuntu.com</code> (as in the top answer in the first link) and do a fresh install when I have the time.

      Maybe you need to rebuild the apt cache:<br>
      <code>cd /var/lib/apt<br>
      sudo mv lists lists.old<br>
      sudo mkdir -p lists/partial<br>
      sudo apt-get update<br>

      Since you are already on Trusty beta and are using the Trusty section of the Ubuntu repos, you should (by now) already have the packages that are used for the official Trusty release.

      It'll be better if you don't move from 12.04 to 13.10 directly. The package scripts are responsible for conversion and creation of new settings which will be messed up if you jump releases like that. You may end up with a buggy system that'll ruin your experience with the new release. It'll be better if you upgrade to 12.10 and then to 13.04. The releases are made that way so you can go from one version to another or from one LTS version to another LTS version.<br/><br/>
      When you've got 13.04, you can further upgrade to 13.10, but I'd really not recommend that. It is still under development and is not suggested for regular use.<br/><br/>
      If you do wish to use 13.10, my suggestion would be to download the .iso file from <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/" target="_blank">here</a> and boot it from a LiveUSB or on a virtual machine on Ubuntu itself. <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> is a great tool for this, and you can run 13.10 without the risk of your system crashing and consequent data loss.<br/><br/>
      Unfortunately, you cannot upgrade directly from 12.04 to 13.10.<br/><br/>
      You have to do all the steps in between as this answer explains: <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/34430/can-i-skip-over-releases-when-upgrading" target="_blank">Can I skip over releases when upgrading?</a><br/><br/>
      So in your case, from 12.04 to 12.10 to 13.04 to 13.10.<br/><br/>
      As this is neither practical nor desirable, I would suggest that you either make a backup of your <code>/home/YOUR_USERNAME</code> folder to keep all your music and other personal files safe and then download the Ubuntu 13.10 image to make a fresh install.<br/><br/>
      Alternatively, you could wait till Ubuntu 14.04 LTS comes out in April and then do an update.<br/><br/>
      The good thing about the second possibility is that you don't have to reinstall your system because you can do direct system upgrades between LTS (Long-Term Support) releases.

      An upgrade from Ubuntu 9.10 to 12.10 is too much effort. Most of the packages will have been updated/upgraded. Chances of breakage are too high. Please save all important files/documents and install a fresh copy of Ubuntu 12.10. It would be better to install 12.04 because it has long-term support.
      As for the problem of not being able to boot from USB, press ESC or F12 or some such button to get into BIOS. It is shown while booting how to get into BIOS.
      Regards,
      "Here's how you boot from the stick: after pressing the power button, the F2 key should be pushed a couple of times to get into the eeePC's BIOS menus. The "quick boot" under the Boot tab should be disabled. Use F10 to save the setting and then as the Netbook reboots hold down the ESC key."

      The beta becomes <code>13.04</code> when it is released, so if you've done an upgrade on or after the release date, you should be running equivalent versions as if you'd directly installed <code>13.04</code>.<br>
      (Depending on what point you started the beta, it is possible that you will still have some cruft from beta versions of various software left around - but if you're running <code>apt-get autoremove</code>, you should have got rid of most of it. You might want to install and run <code>deborphan</code> as well, which can find other redundant packages.)
  - text: |
      You can always download 13.04 iso image and try the live environment and see if you like it. There is no objective answer I suppose. 
      Of course, you should certainly upgrade before the support ends, and for 12.04, it means before April 2017. One reason to upgrade would be that as Ubuntu is coming to phones and tablets, it must become more resource-efficient. As people claim, 13.04 delivers notable improvements in that sense. That means it is likely to do the same tasks faster.
      On the other hand, if you're not an enthusiast who just enjoys new things and doesn't care if they don't work, then it makes sense to wait before moving to a new release. After the first few months, there is hope that most critical bugs have been revealed and fixed.
      I am using 12.04 myself and really wondering whether it is worth the trouble of upgrading to 13.04. Even if you use the release upgrade feature, it makes sense to make backups as things might go wrong (as you can read from various questions here), and the whole process takes time and effort. So maybe wait for 14.04 and upgrade next summer.
      On the other hand, if your current system has any chronic problems, you might want to try if those have been fixed in the newer release.
      <hr>
      EDIT: I upgraded to 13.04, and yes, it is faster, as everybody has been telling me.

      First, copying your home directory to a Windows partition isn't a good idea because there are a few files in your homedir that have specific requirements for permissions, and those permissions will be lost on a Windows partition.<br>
      For a backup, you could make a tar archive of your files and store that archive anywhere. That would preserve all your permissions.<br>
      <code>tar cjvf /windows/c/home_backup.tar.bz2 \"$HOME\"<br>
      </code>
      As far as your Firefox data goes, all that info lives in a hidden directory under your home directory: <code>~/.mozilla/firefox</code>. Back that up, and your Firefox bookmarks are safe.

      The transition between 11.04 to 11.10 was quite dramatic since it involved moving from GTK+2/GNOME libraries to GTK+3/GNOME libraries. This is the supported route that was well tested.
      Similarly well tested is the similar 10.04LTS to 12.04 LTS upgrade.
      Moving from 11.04 to 12.04 in one step is not supported, and I urge you not to go down this route since you are more likely to break your desktop & installation.
      Since you have downloaded 12.04, I would go for a fresh install.
      If you have any files & folders from your 11.04 install, back these up - you can reinstall these later.

#       sudo mount -o bind ~/tmp /var/cache/apt/archives/</code><br>
#       This should give <code>apt</code> plenty of room.

      First, copying your home directory to a Windows partition isn't a good idea because there are a few files in your homedir that have specific requirements for permissions, and those permissions will be lost on a Windows partition.<br>
      For a backup, you could make a tar archive of your files and store that archive anywhere. That would preserve all your permissions.<br>
      <code>tar cjvf /windows/c/home_backup.tar.bz2 \"$HOME\"<br>
      </code>
      As far as your Firefox data goes, all that info lives in a hidden directory under your home directory: <code>~/.mozilla/firefox</code>. Back that up, and your Firefox bookmarks are safe.

      Generally speaking, you shouldn't lose anything if you upgrade. Make a backup beforehand, though!<br>
      See the guide <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes" target="_blank">here</a> on how to upgrade. You're going to have to do it step-by-step (9.10->10.04...).

      An upgrade from Ubuntu 9.10 to 12.10 is too much effort. Most of the packages will have been updated/upgraded. Chances of breakage are too high. Please save all important files/documents and install a fresh copy of Ubuntu 12.10. It would be better to install 12.04 because it has long-term support.
      As for the problem of not being able to boot from USB, press ESC or F12 or some such button to get into BIOS. It is shown while booting how to get into BIOS.
      Regards,
      "Here's how you boot from the stick: after pressing the power button, the F2 key should be pushed a couple of times to get into the eeePC's BIOS menus. The "quick boot" under the Boot tab should be disabled. Use F10 to save the setting and then as the Netbook reboots hold down the ESC key."

      The beta becomes <code>13.04</code> when it is released, so if you've done an upgrade on or after the release date, you should be running equivalent versions as if you'd directly installed <code>13.04</code>.<br>
      (Depending on what point you started the beta, it is possible that you will still have some cruft from beta versions of various software left around - but if you're running <code>apt-get autoremove</code>, you should have got rid of most of it. You might want to install and run <code>deborphan</code> as well, which can find other redundant packages.)

      Both of them suggest that it's probably a mess to upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04 since it would involve 3 upgrades, so it might be easiest to change <code>archive.ubuntu.com</code> to <code>old-releases.ubuntu.com</code> (as in the top answer in the first link) and do a fresh install when I have the time.

      In general, the answer is yes. For most people, the update process will work seamlessly.<br>
      There are, however, always risks. A driver in the new version could be not working as well with your hardware as the previous version. Or something in the upgrade process could be going wrong.<br>
      For package conflicts, you don't have to worry. If they occur, the upgrade will just stop and restore your system.<br>
      If you are talking about a great number of PCs (e.g., in a company), it is, of course, smart to test it on your hardware configurations and in your environment instead of blindly updating on the first day.

      In general, the answer is yes. For most people, the update process will work seamlessly.<br>
      There are, however, always risks. A driver in the new version could be not working as well with your hardware as the previous version. Or something in the upgrade process could be going wrong.<br>
      For package conflicts, you don't have to worry. If they occur, the upgrade will just stop and restore your system.<br>
      If you are talking about a great number of PCs (e.g., in a company), it is, of course, smart to test it on your hardware configurations and in your environment instead of blindly updating on the first day.

      Would I have enough space to upgrade to 11.04 from 10.10?<br>
      That depends on how much space you've used. This <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/forum/installation/DiskSpace" target="_blank">page on Ubuntu wiki (last update 2009)</a> says the bare minimum is 1.8 GB. However, most of that is not new, so an upgrade will probably not require a lot of additional space.<br>

      First, copying your home directory to a Windows partition isn't a good idea because there are a few files in your homedir that have specific requirements for permissions, and those permissions will be lost on a Windows partition.<br>
      For a backup, you could make a tar archive of your files and store that archive anywhere. That would preserve all your permissions.<br>
      <code>tar cjvf /windows/c/home_backup.tar.bz2 \"$HOME\"<br>

      As far as your Firefox data goes, all that info lives in a hidden directory under your home directory: <code>~/.mozilla/firefox</code>. Back that up, and your Firefox bookmarks are safe.

      When you do an upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04, everything was there because the OS was just upgraded (partitions didn't get formatted). Now, however, you are doing a fresh install, which means your partition gets formatted. This means your data won't be there after install (unless you have a separate /home partition, in which case you can select it and choose the option to not format it, and then your data will be there).
      If you only have 1 partition or your home folder is on the same partition as /, then you will lose it as / has to be formatted during reinstall. So make sure you back up your whole /home folder.
      This is the reason why most of us choose to have a separate partition for /home.

      14.04.2 and 14.04.3 are not "releases" in terms of "do-release-upgrade".
      "Point" releases accumulate security updates and bug fixes that are added to Ubuntu repositories.
      If you install ordinary updates on Ubuntu 14.04, 14.04.1, or 14.04.2, you will get 14.04.3.
      So your goal makes no sense.
      The only difference of the ISO of the point releases is <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack" target="_blank">HWE Stack</a>. Kernels are updated to another major version and xserver.
      If this is your question, you can install the 3.16 kernel and graphical stack of 14.04.2 by running:
      <code>sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-utopic xserver-xorg-lts-utopic libqt5gui5 libgles1-mesa-lts-utopic libgles2-mesa-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386 libglapi-mesa-lts-utopic:i386 libegl1-mesa-drivers-lts-utopic</code>
      The command given in the official wiki <a href="https://xpressubuntu.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/how-to-upgrade-to-the-3-16-lts-utopic-kernel-and-graphics-for-ubuntu-14-04/" target="_blank">can break your system in some cases.</a>

      The transition between 11.04 to 11.10 was quite dramatic since it involved moving from GTK+2/GNOME libraries to GTK+3/GNOME libraries. This is the supported route that was well tested.
      Similarly well tested is the similar 10.04LTS to 12.04 LTS upgrade.
      Moving from 11.04 to 12.04 in one step is not supported, and I urge you not to go down this route since you are more likely to break your desktop & installation.
      Since you have downloaded 12.04, I would go for a fresh install.
      If you have any files & folders from your 11.04 install, back these up - you can reinstall these later.

      An upgrade from Ubuntu 9.10 to 12.10 is too much effort. Most of the packages will have been updated/upgraded. Chances of breakage are too high.

      Use the program, <code>libdecodeqr-simpletest</code> provided by the package to read your QR encoded image<br>

      http://www.debian.or.jp<br><br>
      MEBKM:TITLE:DebianJP;URL:http\\://www.debian.or.jp;;</code></pre>
      as can be seen a URL was encoded in the file<br>
      There is also a sample application that works with your webcam called libdecodeqr-webcam<br>
      you need a webcam to use this, I have not tested it.<br>
      IF you would like to generate QR code you can install qrencode from the repositories.<br>
      <pre><code>cat input.txt | qrencode -s 10 -o test.png</code></pre>
      The above will encode the information in the input.txt file in an image file called test.png.<br>
      or you can input text from the console with;<br>
      <pre><code>qrencode -s 10 -o ubuntu.png http://www.ubuntu.com</code></pre>

      I've used both Eclipse for Java and Netbeans for PHP, and I feel Netbeans is a bit stronger for PHP as well as XHTML and CSS. That's my personal preference anyways.<br>

      To my knowledge, there are few comparable software packages available, free and out-of-the-box, for Ubuntu that don't require quite a bit of manual configuration.
      <a href="http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/" target="_blank">OpenNMS</a> might come close for your needs.
      The Network Topology Mapper (and the SolarWinds Tool Suite, in general) is a <em>very</em> good, mid-level network management tool. Unfortunately, it is Windows-only and comes with a significant price tag. Without a great deal of customization, you will be hard-pressed to find a comparable solution. If you have the budget and run a heterogeneous shop, I can strongly recommend using this piece of software. Also, their IPAM and NetFlow tools are quite solid, as well.
      That said, I know of three pieces of software that run on Linux and might give you a start dynamically mapping your network: <a href="http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Cheops</a>, <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/network-performance-management.html" target="_blank">OPManager</a>, and <a href="http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/" target="_blank">OpenNMS</a>.
      I would also recommend looking at the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/mtf/mtf-tools.html" target="_blank">SLAC page</a> to see if there are any more recent developments in the network management space.
      The following applications are listed, in ascending order, in terms of cost, complexity, and feature sets:
      <br>
      Cheops:
      Cheops is a free network mapping solution that will go out and discover and graphically display the servers and network nodes for you. It is old, and possibly no longer under development. But, it is a simple tool to use for network discovery.
      <br>
      <a href="http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/images/cheops.jpg" target="_blank">http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/images/cheops.jpg</a>
      You can download Cheops <a href="http://cheops-ng.sourceforge.net/download.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
      <br>
      OpenNMS:
      OpenNMS is able to do network discovery, event management, and performance management. It is available as a .deb package as well.
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.opennms.org/w/images/a/a9/Example.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.opennms.org/w/images/a/a9/Example.jpg</a>
      Core features:
      - Automatic Layer-2 and Layer-3 link discovery
      - Automatic Network / Node Discovery and Provisioning
      - Automatic Service Discovery and Provisioning
      - IPv6 support throughout (new)
      - Manual Node and Service Provisioning Requisitions
      - Path Outage support
      <br>

      OpenNMS <a href="http://www.opennms.org/get-opennms/" target="_blank">download</a> | <a href="http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Installation:Debian" target="_blank">Installation instructions for deb/apt-get</a>.
      <br>
      OPManager:
      OpManager, on the other hand, is a commercial tool. It has a similar feature set to the SolarWinds solution. In my experience, it is very robust and customizable. That said, you will have to pay for it. It does run on Debian-based systems, though it is not custom-tailored for Ubuntu. YMMV.
      <br>
      <img src="https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/images/screenshot/network-mapping.gif" alt="">
      In terms of network management functionality, it supports:
      - Availability and Uptime Monitoring
      - Traffic and Utilization Monitoring
      - Cisco Monitoring
      - Network Device Health Monitoring (Router, Switch, Firewall, wireless access points)
      - Network Mapping
      - Custom Network Maps / Network Traffic Maps
      - WAN RTT Monitoring
      - Network Traffic Analysis (NetFlow, sFlow)
      - VoIP Monitoring
      - Network Configuration Management
      - IP Address Management
      - Switch Port Mapper
      <br>
      For a full list of features, see <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/features.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      You can download a free trial of OPManager <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/network-monitoring/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      <br>
      I would be very interested in hearing from others regarding a free, unified network management solution in Ubuntu that does not require in-house development and a great deal of care and feeding.
      In the meantime, when it's unreasonable to use OPManager or OpenNMS, I will have to make do with my own custom Nagios/Cacti/SmokePing/Rancid/IPPlan solution for smaller networks.

      I'm using VLC. It works pretty good for what I do. The pause/resume feature works out of the box.
      <br>
      You will have to scan for channels first. Use <a href="http://edafe.org/vdr/w_scan/" target="_blank"><code>w_scan</code></a> (<a href="http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/w-scan" target="_blank">install it if necessary</a>) and launch the following command:
      <br>
      <code>w_scan -c FR -X &gt; channels.conf</code>
      <br>
      Replace FR with your country (<code>w_scan -c ?</code> to get the list). Now, each time you want to watch TV, just launch this command:
      <br>
      <code>vlc channels.conf</code>
      <br>
      You can start recording with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> and stop it again. Pause a live program with <kbd>Space</kbd>.
      <br>
      There is a good wiki about DVB in French: <a href="http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/tnt" target="_blank">http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/tnt</a> (has a list of compatible hardware).
      <h2>Others</h2>

I used to use Kaffeine but dropped it for VLC because I had some issues. Just retested it and it seems to work nicely. It is a good program for recording (instant or scheduled record as you want). Maybe I should reconsider my actual choice for watching DVB.

      Lubuntu 14.10 is not an LTS release. It is supported for 9 months, which means the support will be dropped in less than 3 months. Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade. If you do not want to upgrade frequently, consider installing an LTS release. The current LTS release is 14.04.

  utter_recommend/see/launcher/details:

      To read the contents of the launcher file, you can open gedit and drag&amp;drop a launcher icon from the dash into it. Gedit will then display the .desktop file for that launcher, which is stored in <code>/usr/share/applications</code>.<br>
      In my case, for example:<br>
      <code>#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
      [Desktop Entry]
      Version=1.0
      Type=Application
      Name=Desura
      GenericName=Game Manager

      Terminal=false
      Categories=Game;

      Now, just look at the 'Exec=' line in that document. In my case:<br>
      <code>Exec=/home/daniel/desura/desura %U</code><br>
      This will point you to where the executable is stored and tell you the name (desura).<br>
      By the way, normally it is neither necessary nor a good idea to run desura in root mode.

      <h2>Bash Arithmetic</h2>
      Another possible solution is to add a simple function for Bash's builtin arithmetic. Put this in your <code>.bashrc</code> file to try:<br>
      <pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>=() {
          echo $(($@))
      }</code></pre>
      So now, you don't even need <code>$((...))</code> anymore, just <code>=</code> which seems natural enough.<br>
      <h3>Replacement</h3>
      Another thing if you want to be even faster: you can make it replace <code>p</code> with <code>+</code> and <code>x</code> with <code>*</code>. This will work for that:<br>
      <pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>=() {
          calc=${@//p/+}
          calc=${calc//x/*}
          echo $(($calc))
      }</code></pre>
      Now you don't even need <kbd>Shift</kbd> anymore, the only thing is <code>= </code> in front of arithmetic.<br>
      <h3>Hexadecimal output</h3>
      Output can be displayed in both decimal and hexadecimal if desired. (Note: using <code>x</code> substitution will conflict with the <code>0x...</code> hex syntax)<br>
      <pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>=() {
          answer=$(($@))
          printf '%s' $answer
          bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt; obase=16;ans=$answer;print \\ (0x\\,ans,\\)\\\<br>\\
      }</code></pre>
      (uses Bash for arithmetic but bc for final decimal to hex conversion)<br>
      Example:<br>
      <pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>$ = 16 + 0x10
      272 (0x110)
      $ = 16**3 + 16**4
      69632 (0x11000)</code></pre>
      <h2>Using bc</h2>
      If you want slightly more advanced calculations, you can pipe it to <code>bc</code> like so:<br>
      <pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>=() {
          calc=${@//p/+}
          calc=${calc//x/*}
          bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt;scale=10;$calc
      }</code></pre>
      = 'sqrt(2)' # Returns 1.4142135623<br>
      = '4*a(1)'  # Returns pi (3.1415926532)<br>
      The functions provided by <code>bc</code> are as follows (and can be found from <code>man bc</code>):<br>
      <pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>sqrt ( expression )
            The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the expression.
            If the expression is negative, a run-time error is generated.
      s (x)  The sine of x, x is in radians.
      c (x)  The cosine of x, x is in radians.
      a (x)  The arctangent of x, arctangent returns radians.

      e (x)  The exponential function of raising e to the value x.
      j (n,x)
            The Bessel function of integer order n of x.
      </code></pre>
      It also supports <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and variables like a programming language, though it may be better to write to a file if you wanted that.<br>
      Keep in mind that it will substitute <code>p</code> and <code>x</code> in function/variable names. It may be better to just remove the replacements.<br>
      <h2>Using gcalccmd</h2>
      You can also make the function call <code>gcalccmd</code> (from <code>gnome-calculator</code>) like so:<br>
      <pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"><code>=() {
          calc=$@
          # Uncomment the below for (p → +) and (x → *)
          #calc=${calc//p/+}
          #calc=${calc//x/*}
          echo -ne $calc\<br> quit | gcalccmd | sed 's:^&gt; ::g'
      }</code></pre>
      The available functions seem to be (taken straight from the <a href="http://sourcecodebrowser.com/gcalctool/5.29.2/mp-equation_8c.html#a2c1b83394ed2fe6da08e1538b65fd29b" target="_blank">source code</a>), <code>==</code> denotes equivalent functions:<br>

If you don't find it, you can check the <a href='http://shutter-project.org/faq-help/ppa-installation-guide/' target='_blank'>detailed installation instructions</a> which will give you a PPA for it. It's a really handy screen capture application with easy-to-use plug-ins to give a nice touch to your screenshots and many other features to easily share the files. It offers in-house image editing and special effects (via plug-ins) to enhance the quality of your screenshots. You can access these options via the menu (1) or the toolbar (2).<br><br>
      <img src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/KEoWl.png' alt='alt text'><br>
      <em>The effects here are all done with Shutter (Plug-in <code>Reflexion</code> and Edit <code>auto-increment shape</code>).</em><br><br>
      And then to publish them, I just right-click in Shutter and choose Export (3). Then I publish it via Ubuntu One. I go to the directory where I published the file, right-click on it, and select <code>Copy Ubuntu One public URL</code>. Finally, when I comment, I click on <code>img</code> in the small toolbar and select <code>From the web</code> and paste the link that was copied in the previous step. It's easy and fully integrated. For those on 10.04, check that you have <a href='http://shutter-project.org/downloads/dependencies/' target='_blank'>all shutter dependencies</a>, as you might miss some of the plug-ins. For users on Ubuntu 10.10, this should be fixed.

      KeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe that helps you manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.<br>

      One thing I know of (but don't like the interface very much) is <a href='http://edgytech.com/umongo/' target='_blank'>UMongo</a>, which is a desktop, not browser-based application. Here's a screenshot:<br><img src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbowF.png' alt='a screenshot of UMongo'><br>
      So far I've been using <a href='http://www.jumperz.net/index.php?i=2&amp;a=0&amp;b=9' target='_blank'>MonjaDB</a> - it's an Eclipse plug-in, and Eclipse is my IDE anyway. I like it; it seems to have all the features I used to use in <a href='http://rockmongo.com/' target='_blank'>RockMongo</a>.<br>
      Here's a screenshot from MonjaDB (there are more on his website, as well as some instructions):<br><img src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/gA3fp.png' alt='a screenshot of MonjaDB'><br>
      To install it, you obviously need Eclipse (which you can get from the Ubuntu repositories). Once you've done that, you need to go to the Help -> Install New Software... and then add <a href='http://www.jumperz.net/update/' target='_blank'>this update site</a>. Although I like it, I don't think many people will switch IDEs just for a GUI for Mongo (although I could be mistaken).<br>
      Both UMongo and MonjaDB have their source code on GitHub.

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      calibre is a free and open-source e-book library management application developed by users of e-books for users of e-books.
      Calibre is primarily an ebook cataloging program. It manages your ebook collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the logical book, i.e., a single entry in the database that may correspond to ebooks in several formats. It also supports conversion from a dozen different ebook formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the Convert E-books button.
      Supported input formats are: MOBI, AZW, LIT, PRC, EPUB, ODT, HTML, CBR, CBZ, RTF, TXT, PDF, and LRS.

      <h2>Starting calibre's ebook viewer as a standalone application</h2>
      In certain cases, you will not want to add an epub or mobi file to calibre's library before reading it. Luckily, calibre's ebook viewer can be started independently via <code>ebook-viewer</code>. This makes it possible to create a standalone launcher:

      Ok - I don\'t know if You like it, but it is a somewhat solution:<br><br>
      create a text file PowerOff.sh (with gedit for example) and write there (if Your default shell is bash - if other You\'ll probably know what to do):<br><br>
      <pre><code>#!/bin/bash <br>sudo shutdown -h now<br></code></pre><br><br>
      Click it with Your right mouse button and in proerties: allow to execute as program.<br><br>
      It would be comfy to copy this file in some hidden location (i mean not to leave it on desktop).<br><br>
      After that You need to modify a file /etc/sudoers:<br><br>
      <pre><code>sudo gedit /etc/sudoers<br></code></pre><br><br>
      at the end of this file add:<br><br>
      <pre><code>user ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown<br></code></pre><br><br>
      where user is Your user name f.ex. thonixx if that is how you log in Ubuntu<br><br>
      OK, now create an activator on Your panel, click it with right mouse button, and choose:add to panel ->  add activator -> your own activator -> type: program in terminal and choose Your created file PowerOff.sh<br><br>
      Now it should be possible to shutdown Your PC by clicking the activator on Your panel. if You wish You could even give it an icon of Your choice<br><br>
      In that manner You could possibly make other commands. Or even write a simple python wrapper to show a form letting You to choose if You want to reboot, shutdown, logout etc.<br>
      I gave You the solution without poping out the shutdown dialog, because You didn't really mention which shutdown button makes this errors. You could make identical solution using the command:<br><br>
      <pre><code>gnome-session-save --shutdown-dialog<br></code></pre><br><br>
      in bash file instead shutdown. In such case You would probably not need to edit /etc/sudoers<br><br>

      <strong>You do not need a workaround, just change the policy to allow you to shut down without authenticating as admin for shutdown and reboot when multiple users are logged in.</strong>
      Edit the file /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.consolekit.policy using your favorite text editor. You will need root permissions.
      Change the section relating to shutdown when others are logged in from:

          <allow_active>yes</allow_active>
        </defaults>
      </action>
      ```
      and the section relating to rebooting when others are logged in from:
      ```
      <action id="org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart-multiple-users">
        <description>Restart the system when multiple users are logged in</description>
        <message>System policy prevents restarting the system when other users are logged in</message>
        <defaults>
          <allow_inactive>no</allow_inactive>
          <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>
        </defaults>
      </action>
      ```
      to:
      ```
      <action id="org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart-multiple-users">

      Yes, that's correct. Note that only root can run the shutdown command by default. So, if you have not done any tweaking with the permission of running the command, just put the cron entry in the root user's cron (<code>sudo crontab -e</code>) or add the entry in <code>/etc/crontab</code> mentioning the user as root.<br><br>
      <strong>EDIT (Regarding Anacron):</strong> Absolutely bad idea. Generally, anacron is used when you want to run a command daily but you are not sure whether your computer will be On or Off. So, let's say you have added an anacron entry to run a command. Then if the computer is On, anacron checks and runs the command. If the computer was Off at that specified time, the instant you turn On the computer next time, anacron will run that command.<br><br>
      So, in a nutshell, anacron is used when you are not sure whether your computer is going to be On or Off. In your case, you are shutting down the computer, so if you put that to run by anacron, your computer will be shut down by anacron if it was off and when you turn it On after the specified time.<br><br>
      Your command:<br>
      <pre><code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron || : 30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now</code></pre>
      means that run <code>30 7 * * * root start -q anacron</code> first, if that fails, run <code>30 17 * * * root /sbin/shutdown -h now</code>. It doesn't make sense, I think. Just add the entry in crontab, and that'll do the job.

      <h2>Scheduling a shutdown</h2>
      To shutdown, run the command:<br>
      <pre><code>sudo shutdown -P +60</code></pre>
      That will wait 60 mins before starting the shutdown sequence.<br><br>
      You could do:<br>
      <pre><code>sudo shutdown -P 1:00</code></pre>
      to shutdown at 1 AM and<br>
      <pre><code>sudo shutdown -P now</code></pre>
      to shutdown now.<br><br>
      A message is broadcast to all terminals to warn about the shutdown.<br><br>
      <h2>Cancel a pending shutdown</h2>
      After starting a shutdown, if the time argument is <strong>not</strong> "+0" or "now", you can use:<br>
      <pre><code>sudo shutdown -c</code></pre>
      to cancel the scheduled shutdown.

      <p>From the MAN PAGES:</p>
      <p><strong>Shutdown</strong> - "shutdown arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way. All logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and, within the last five minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented." Time mentioned here is an amount specified by the user that is shutting down.</p>
      <p><strong>Halt</strong> - "These programs allow a system administrator to reboot, halt or power off the system."</p>
      <p>The difference is that Halt can be more "aggressive" when shutting down than Shutdown itself. It has parameters that can literally force the system to shutdown without regarding services or opened programs. If you run halt without any parameters, it will simply execute the shutdown command. Something like an alias. If you run it, for example, with the parameter <code>--force</code>, it will "force" the system into a reboot really fast.</p>
      <p>In the case of halt or shutdown, they will wait for all processes to finish correctly before turning the PC off or rebooting. If a service or app does not close or does not close properly, you will see what you mention there (The Ubuntu logo with the dots).</p>
      <p>The proper way in the terminal for a single user or multi-user is shutdown. But if the shutdown is not working, verify what services you have running and which one is causing the slowness or freezing of the shutdown.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, there are several ways to reboot or shutdown the system:</p>
      <p><strong>Rebooting</strong> - <code>shutdown -r</code>, <code>reboot</code></p>
      <p>In this case, reboot is simply calling <code>shutdown -r</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Shutting Down</strong> - <code>halt</code>, <code>shutdown</code>, <code>sudo init 0</code>, <code>shutdown -h now</code>, <code>poweroff</code></p>
      <p>In this case, <code>poweroff</code> is the same as calling <code>shutdown -P</code>.</p>
      <p>As you have noticed, the <code>shutdown</code> command can do a lot of stuff. Here is a small list of its parameters:</p>
      <pre><code>-r  Requests that the system be rebooted after it has been brought down
      -h  Requests that the system be either halted or powered off after it has been brought down, with the choice as to which left up to the system
      -H  Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down
      -P  Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down
      -c  Cancels a running shutdown. TIME is not specified with this option, the first argument is MESSAGE
      -k  Only send out the warning messages and disable logins, do not actually bring the system down
      </code></pre>
      <p>As does the <code>reboot</code> command:</p>
      <pre><code>-f, --force                 force reboot or halt, don't call shutdown(8)
      -p, --poweroff              switch off the power when called as halt
      </code></pre>
      <p>There is, however, a difference between shutting down through the terminal and clicking on the Shutdown option in Unity. The latter will ask the user for interaction with any unsaved work (like LibreOffice, Inkscape...). The former will simply send a signal to all processes telling them to close. No user interaction will be needed, so any unsaved work will be gone.</p>

      Some boot-up and shutdown configurations were scrambled during one installation, which was set to install recovery options on additional software among other installation tryouts.
      Those unwanted software parts were installed in the /lib/recovery-mode/recovery-menu directory at the root (/) partition. This was causing the recovery booting option to open a pink/purple recovery menu with some non-working functions.
      And, I think, it was somehow causing the non-verbosity on the shutdown process despite enabling it in /etc/default/grub.
      After all, the additional software menu seems to have several non-working options, and I think some of them should be removed or fixed.

      The reason can be anything, but try running this command to shutdown:
      <pre><code>sudo systemctl poweroff</code></pre>

      I reinstalled, and that resolved the problem.
