    <p>You can download it from <a href="http://panasonic.net/pcc/support/fax/common/table/linuxdriver.html">the Panasonic webpage</a> you linked. Here's how to install the 64-bit driver:</p>
    <p>Open a terminal with <code>Ctrl+Alt+T</code>, and type/paste the following line-by-line:</p>
    <pre>wget -O- http://cs.psn-web.net/support/fax/common/file/Linux_PrnDriver/Driver_Install_files/mccgdi-2.0.3-x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz
    cd mccgdi-2.0.3-x86_64
    sudo ./install-driver</pre>
    <p>You should see output like the below, after which the driver will be installed. Once it's working, you can remove the <code>mccgdi...</code> folder from Nautilus.</p>
    <pre>start  install......
    start install files......
    restart spooler - CUPS<br>
    Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)
    utility, e.g. service cups restart<br>
    Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an
    Upstart job, you may also use the stop(8) and then start(8) utilities,
    e.g. stop cups ; start cups. The restart(8) utility is also available.
    cups stop/waiting
    cups start/running, process 2824<br>
    install driver completed<br>
    please use "system-config-printer" or "lpadmin" to add printer</pre>
    <h3>2. Installing the 32-bit scanner driver on 64-bit Ubuntu</h3>
    <p>There is no guarantee this will actually work, since I don't have a MB1900CX to test it...</p>
    <p>You have already installed <code>ia32-libs</code> so you shouldn't need the following, but if <code>dpkg</code> complains trying to install the scanner drivers, you should do the following in a terminal:</p>
    <pre>sudo apt-get install gcc-4.6-base:i386 libc6:i386 libgcc1:i386 libusb-0.1-4:i386</pre>
    <p>Download the 32-bit Panasonic <em>libsane</em> driver with:</p>
    <pre>wget http://cs.psn-web.net/support/fax/common/file/Linux_ScanDriver/libsane-panamfs-1.0.0-i386.deb</pre>
    <p>And install it with:</p>
    <pre>sudo dpkg -i libsane-panamfs-1.0.0-i386.deb</pre>
    <p>If all goes well, you will see output like the below, and your scanner functions should also work:</p>

    If you installed drivers from the Epson site, they require some other packages to be installed too. But the problem is that 13.10 is not supported anymore, and you won't get these packages from the repository.
    There is a way to connect the "old-releases" repository, but I suggest upgrading the system to 14.04.
    This will be closed as off-topic anyway since the question is about an unsupported release.'

They are available on the <a href="https://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=266642&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=OSF_O_LINUX">Epson website</a>. To use them, you will need to install a specific package as mentioned in the Epson downloads:
    <code>sudo apt-get install lsb</code>
    The specific package that you need to download depends on your version of Ubuntu. If you are running a 32-bit Ubuntu, download <code>epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_i386.deb</code>,
    And if you are running 64-bit Ubuntu, download <code>epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb</code>.
    These files can be opened using the Ubuntu Software Center by double-clicking on them or installed from the command line by the command:
    <code>sudo dpkg -i epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb</code>'
